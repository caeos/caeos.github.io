      <description>Questions What&amp;rsquo;s CAEOS? I thought this project was named Coner? CAEOS stands for &amp;ldquo;Coner is Autocross Event Operations Software&amp;rdquo;.
There was already a user with the name Coner on GitHub, so an alternative was necessary. This will do!
When can I run my autocross with Coner? Coner is a labor of love by its lead developer, but it does not pay his bills, nor does he wish that it would.</description>
