## Questions

### What's CAEOS? I thought this project was named Coner?

CAEOS stands for "Coner is Autocross Event Operations Software".

There was already a user with the name Coner on GitHub, so an alternative was necessary. This will do!

### When can I run my autocross with Coner?

Coner is a labor of love by its lead developer, but it does not pay his bills, nor does he wish that it would. It will be ready when it's ready.

Perhaps you could help it along by [contributing]({{< relref "contributing.md" >}})?

### What's a Handicap Group and a Competition Group?

These are abstractions for what a popular autocross sanctioning body whose acronym starts with S and ends with A might call a Class or a Category, respectively. Coner is not affiliated with any sanctioning body, so it seemed unwise to bake their terminology into our data structures.
